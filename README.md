Core Components
1. AWS Lambda Function

Function Name: realtimechat

2. Trigger Mechanism

API Gateway: Serves as the HTTP endpoint trigger for your Lambda function
Provides RESTful API endpoints for your frontend application
Handles request routing, authentication, and rate limiting
Enables CORS for cross-origin requests from your Netlify-hosted frontend

3. AI Integration

Amazon Bedrock: Provides access to Claude 3 Haiku model
Claude 3 Haiku: Fast, cost-effective AI model optimized for real-time responses
Generates intelligent, contextual responses to viewer interactions

How It Works
Real-Time Chat Processing Workflow:

User Interaction: Viewer sends a message through your web interface
API Gateway: Receives HTTP request and validates it
Lambda Trigger: API Gateway invokes your realtimechat Lambda function
Message Processing: Lambda function:

Parses incoming chat message
Applies content filtering and moderation
Prepares context for AI processing


AI Response Generation: Lambda calls Amazon Bedrock with Claude 3 Haiku to:

Generate intelligent, engaging responses
Maintain conversation context
Provide relevant viewer engagement


Response Delivery: Lambda returns the AI-generated response through API Gateway
Real-Time Display: Frontend receives and displays the response to viewers
